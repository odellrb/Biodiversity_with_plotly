## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a dynamic web page that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The page includes three charts: a bar chart that illustrates the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button. By choosing a volunteers (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences across multiple test subjects.
